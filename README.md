# Shuttle Service using Web Application
Shuttle service system designed to improve passenger experiences by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) and web technologies. The system incorporates GPS for real-time shuttle tracking, ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, and motor drivers for speed control, integrated through a NodeMCU that connects to a React JS-based web application. This application displays the shuttle's location on Google Maps, offers digital payment functionalities via Razorpay, and utilizes a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict shuttle arrival times accurately. This setup not only improves operational efficiency by providing real-time data on shuttle location and estimated arrival times but also enhances user interaction and satisfaction by allowing for seamless digital transactions and reliable service updates directly accessible through smartphones and computers.
