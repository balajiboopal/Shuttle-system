# **Smart Shuttle Service 🚍📍**  
*Real-Time Web Application for Efficient Shuttle Tracking & Route Optimization*  

##  **Overview**  
This project implements a **smart shuttle service** that enables **real-time tracking, route optimization, and estimated time of arrival (ETA) prediction** using **Machine Learning & IoT integration**. The system helps commuters track shuttle locations, plan trips efficiently, and reduce wait times by optimizing routes dynamically.  

##  **Features**  
 **Real-Time Shuttle Tracking** – Uses GPS and IoT sensors to provide live location updates.  
 **Route Optimization** – Implements A* and Dijkstra algorithms for shortest path routing.  
 **ETA Prediction with Machine Learning** – Uses **Random Forest** to estimate arrival times.  
 **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Built with **React.js** for seamless trip planning.  
 **Scalable API for Future Integration** – Easily extendable for ride-sharing and multi-vehicle support.
